# DistButterfly

A distributed-memory implementation of the butterfly algorithm.
In particular, the current implementation performs analytical interpolation
in order to efficiently apply Egorov-like operators with user-defined 
black-box phase functions. Please see 
[A parallel butterfly algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4650) for more 
details.
